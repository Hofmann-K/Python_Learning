   * Running scripts
   * Working with virtual environments

#### Projects:

* **Mini Project:** Create your first repository and a small Python ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù app. Practice pushing commits and updating a README.
* **Capstone Project:** A simple **Git-tracked command-line to-do list app**. This builds terminal, Git, and Python comfort simultaneously.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Milestone 3: Working with Modules, Packages, and Libraries**

**Goal:** Learn to use Python‚Äôs standard and third-party libraries effectively.

#### Topics:

1. Importing and using modules (`math`, `os`, `datetime`, etc.)
2. Installing packages with `pip`
3. Using `virtualenv` and environments in VS Code
4. Intro to popular libraries:

   * `numpy` (arrays, vectorized operations)
   * `pandas` (dataframes, filtering, aggregation)
   * `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (basic plotting)

#### Projects:

* **Mini Projects:**

  * CSV data analysis using pandas
  * Plot a player‚Äôs performance graph
* **Capstone Project:**
  **Hockey Data Analyzer:** Read and visualize NHL statistics from a CSV file using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

### üß© **Milestone 4: Intermediate Python ‚Äî OOP and Advanced Concepts**

**Goal:** Develop deeper understanding and start writing more organized, reusable code.

#### Topics:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance)
2. Modules and Packages (creating your own)
3. Recursion
4. Generators and Iterators
5. Decorators and Context Managers
6. Working with JSON data (important for APIs)

#### Projects:

### üåê **Milestone 5: APIs and Web Data**

**Goal:** Learn to interact with online data using APIs and Python‚Äôs request libraries.

#### Topics:

1. HTTP basics (GET, POST)
2. Using `requests` and `json` to call APIs
3. Authentication and headers
4. Handling API errors
5. Parsing and storing fetched data

#### Projects:

* **Mini Projects:**

  * Weather forecast app
  * NHL API player stats fetcher
* **Capstone Project:**
  **Hockey Analytics Dashboard (with API):**
  Fetch real-time player stats from the NHL API and visualize them with `matplotlib`.

### üß† **Milestone 6: Introduction to Machine Learning**

**Goal:** Learn the foundations of machine learning and understand scikit-learn‚Äôs workflow.

#### Topics:

1. What is Machine Learning? (concepts + intuition)
2. Data preprocessing with `pandas` and `sklearn`
3. Feature scaling, encoding, and splitting data
4. Basic models:

   * Linear Regression
   * Logistic Regression
   * Decision Trees
   * k-NN
5. Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
6. Introduction to `XGBoost` and model tuning

#### Projects:

* **Mini Projects:**

  * Predict hockey player performance based on stats
  * Simple cybersecurity anomaly detector
* **Capstone Project:**
  **Player Performance Predictor:**
  Use real-world player stats (from CSV or API) to predict next-game goals or performance with `sklearn` and `XGBoost`.

---

### üöÄ **Milestone 7: Advanced Topics and Real-World Practice**

**Goal:** Work on larger projects that integrate data, ML, APIs, and version control.

#### Topics:

1. Model deployment basics
2. Using APIs with ML models
3. Intro to Flask or FastAPI (to serve models)
